# Infographic Challenge project

This project's objective is to recreate the graphs of the 2006 GapMinder Ted Talk by Hans Rosling in order to discuss and analyze the statistics. This data science project answers and justifies how the health compared to the wealth of each country in the world from the year 1960 to the year 2000. The Google Colab file is uploaded with the term project as a whole, and the code is uploaded one more time, alone, in a separate file. Here is our final result for the year 2000.
